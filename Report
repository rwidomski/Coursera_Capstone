Introduction/Business Problem
In Seattle, there are many accidents with various levels of severity, from little damage to multiple 
fatalities. Each accident can occur for a variety of reasons such as user error, weather conditions or 
can even be caused from how the roadway was designed and constructed.A big goal of any community is to 
prevent accidents from occurring to increase the safety of the public and decrease the chances of a fatality. 
Through this project I will look for patterns in the data that can help the police department and the City of 
Seattle to decrease the amount of accidents and increase safety in the Seattle community

Data
This data comes from the Seattle Police Department and describes a numerous amount of accidents 
that have taken place. Each accident shows the severity rating with a number 0-3, 0 being unknown,
1 being prop damage, 2 being injury and 3 being a fatality. For each accident, there are reported 
items including where the accident took place, the conditions of the road, the time of day, how 
the accident took place, etc. Each instance in the dataset will be used to make predictions about 
the severity of future possible accidents and to make recommendations to prevent serious accidents 
from occurring.
